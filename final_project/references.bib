               dynamics of a disordered linear chain,? is reviewed. Contained
               in this work is an exact solution of the so-called type I chain
               in the case of the disorder variables being given by a gamma
               distribution. The exact solution exhibits a singularity in the
               density of states about the origin, which has since been shown
               to be universal for one-dimensional tight binding models with
               off diagonal disorder. We discuss this context and also point
               out some universal features of the weak disorder expansion of
               the exact solution near the band edge. Furthermore, a link
               between the exact solution and a tridiagonal formalism of
               anti-symmetric Gaussian ?-ensembles with ? proportional to 1/N
               is made.",

               you what is really going on, why it is worth doing, and how it
               is related to familiar ideas in other areas. The monograph is

@ARTICLE{Filoche2012-av,
  title    = "Universal mechanism for Anderson and weak localization",
  author   = "Filoche, Marcel and Mayboroda, Svitlana",
  abstract = "Localization of stationary waves occurs in a large variety of
              vibrating systems, whether mechanical, acoustical, optical, or
              quantum. It is induced by the presence of an inhomogeneous
              medium, a complex geometry, or a quenched disorder. One of its
              most striking and famous manifestations is Anderson localization,
              responsible for instance for the metal-insulator transition in
              disordered alloys. Yet, despite an enormous body of related
              literature, a clear and unified picture of localization is still
              to be found, as well as the exact relationship between its many
              manifestations. In this paper, we demonstrate that both Anderson
              and weak localizations originate from the same universal
              mechanism, acting on any type of vibration, in any dimension, and
              for any domain shape. This mechanism partitions the system into
              weakly coupled subregions. The boundaries of these subregions
              correspond to the valleys of a hidden landscape that emerges from
              the interplay between the wave operator and the system geometry.
              The height of the landscape along its valleys determines the
              strength of the coupling between the subregions. The landscape
              and its impact on localization can be determined rigorously by
              solving one special boundary problem. This theory allows one to
              predict the localization properties, the confining regions, and
              to estimate the energy of the vibrational eigenmodes through the
              properties of one geometrical object. In particular, Anderson
              localization can be understood as a special case of weak
              localization in a very rough landscape.",

  abstract      = "Consider $N\times N$ symmetric one-dimensional random band
                   matrices with general distribution of the entries and band
                   width $W \geq N^\{3/4+\varepsilon\}$ for any
                   $\varepsilon>0$. In the bulk of the spectrum and in the
                   large $N$ limit, we obtain the following results. (i) The
                   semicircle law holds up to the scale $N^\{-1+\varepsilon\}$
                   for any $\varepsilon>0$. (ii) The eigenvalues locally
                   converge to the point process given by the Gaussian
                   orthogonal ensemble at any fixed energy. (iii) All
                   eigenvectors are delocalized, meaning their $\{\rm
                   L\}^\infty$ norms are all simultaneously bounded by
                   $N^\{-\frac\{1\}\{2\}+\varepsilon\}$ (after normalization in
                   $\{\rm L\}^2$) with overwhelming probability, for any
                   $\varepsilon>0$. (iv )Quantum unique ergodicity holds, in
                   the sense that the local $\{\rm L\}^2$ mass of eigenvectors
                   becomes equidistributed with overwhelming probability. We
                   extend the mean-field reduction method
                   \textbackslashcite\{BouErdYauYin2017\}, which required
                   $W=\Omega(N)$, to the current setting $W \ge
                   N^\{3/4+\varepsilon\}$. Two new ideas are: (1) A new
                   estimate on the ``generalized resolvent'' of band matrices
                   when $W \geq N^\{3/4+\varepsilon\}$. Its proof, along with
                   an improved fluctuation average estimate, will be presented
                   in parts 2 and 3 of this series \textbackslashcite
                   \{BouYanYauYin2018,YanYin2018\}. (2) A strong (high
                   probability) version of the quantum unique ergodicity
                   property of random matrices. For its proof, we construct
                   perfect matching observables of eigenvector overlaps and
                   show they satisfying the eigenvector moment flow equation

              understanding the response of such networks as a function of the
              prestrain. To this end we consider a chain [one-dimensional (1D)
              network] of elastic springs upon which a random, zero mean,
              finite variance prestrain is imposed. Numerical simulations and
              analytical predictions quantify the magnitude of the contraction
              as a function of the variance of the prestrain, and show that the
              chain always shrinks. To test these predictions, we vary the
              topology of the chain, consider more complex connectivity and
              show that our results are relatively robust to these changes.",
