  abstract  = "The first work of Dyson relating to random matrix theory, ?The
               dynamics of a disordered linear chain,? is reviewed. Contained
               in this work is an exact solution of the so-called type I chain
               in the case of the disorder variables being given by a gamma
               distribution. The exact solution exhibits a singularity in the
               density of states about the origin, which has since been shown
               to be universal for one-dimensional tight binding models with
               off diagonal disorder. We discuss this context and also point
               out some universal features of the weak disorder expansion of
               the exact solution near the band edge. Furthermore, a link
               between the exact solution and a tridiagonal formalism of
               anti-symmetric Gaussian ?-ensembles with ? proportional to 1/N
               is made.",

  author    = "Chung, Fan R K",
  abstract  = "Beautifully written and elegantly presented, this book is based
               on 10 lectures given at the CBMS workshop on spectral graph
               theory in June 1994 at Fresno State University. Chung's
               well-written exposition can be likened to a conversation with a
               good teacher - one who not only gives you the facts, but tells
               you what is really going on, why it is worth doing, and how it
               is related to familiar ideas in other areas. The monograph is
               accessible to the nonexpert who is interested in reading about
               this evolving area of mathematics.",
